The artifact selected for this milestone is the CS465 Travlr Getaways full-stack web application, which was originally created during the CS465 course. This project is a web-based travel management system that includes a frontend user interface, a backend server, and a database for storing travel and booking data. The artifact demonstrates how different parts of a software system work together to create a functional application. It was created as part of a course project to practice fullstack development concepts and real-world software design.
This artifact was included in my ePortfolio because it clearly demonstrates my skills in software development, problem solving, and system design. The project showcases important components such as structured code organization, routing, data handling, and database integration. I selected this artifact because it reflects my ability to design and improve a working application rather than just write isolated code. The enhancements focused on improving readability, organization, and functionality, which helped make the application easier to understand and maintain. These improvements better demonstrate professional software development practices.
Through this enhancement, I met the course outcomes I planned to address in Module One, particularly those related to designing and implementing computing solutions and using appropriate tools and techniques. The project shows progress toward outcomes involving software engineering, databases, and algorithmic thinking. At this time, no major updates to my outcome coverage plan are needed, as the enhancements align well with my original goals. However, I plan to continue refining the project to strengthen connections to additional outcomes, such as security and professional communication.
Enhancing and modifying this artifact helped me better understand the importance of planning, testing, and refining software over time. I learned how small improvements in structure and logic can greatly improve the quality of an application. One challenge I faced was identifying which parts of the code needed improvement without breaking existing functionality. This process taught me how to carefully review my work and make thoughtful changes. Overall, this experience helped me grow as a software developer and better prepare my work for professional presentation in my ePortfolio.
