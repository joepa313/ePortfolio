The artifact selected for this milestone is the CS465 Travlr Getaways full-stack web application, originally created during the CS465 course. The project is a travel management web application that includes a frontend interface, a backend API, and database integration. For this milestone in CS-499, the artifact was enhanced to focus on algorithms and data structures by improving how trip data is processed and analyzed.
This artifact was included in my ePortfolio because it demonstrates my ability to apply algorithms and data structures in a real-world application. I selected this project because it works with collections of data, making it well suited for filtering, searching, and sorting operations. The enhancements added server-side logic that allows trips to be filtered by resort, searched by keywords, and sorted by price or trip length using array-based algorithms. Additional logic was added to calculate basic trip statistics, which further demonstrates effective use of data structures and algorithmic thinking.
These enhancements met the course outcomes I planned to address in Module One related to algorithms and data structures. The improved artifact shows how algorithmic logic can enhance application performance and usability. No updates to my outcome-coverage plan are needed at this time, as the enhancement aligns well with my original goals.
Enhancing this artifact helped me better understand how algorithms are applied in full-stack applications. I learned how organizing and processing data with efficient logic improves functionality and maintainability. One challenge was adding new logic without breaking existing features, which required careful testing. Overall, this process strengthened my problem-solving skills and prepared the artifact for professional presentation in my ePortfolio
