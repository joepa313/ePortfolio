# My ePortfolio
Welcome to my GitHub Pages ePortfolio.

Self-Assessment
Completing my coursework in the Computer Science program has helped me grow from someone who was just learning how code works to someone who understands how to design, build, improve, and secure full systems. Throughout this program, I did not just learn how to write code — I learned how to think like a developer, solve problems logically, and build applications that deliver real value.
One of the biggest areas of growth for me was learning how to collaborate and communicate in a technical environment. In several courses, I had to explain my design decisions, document my code, and present projects in a way that both technical and nontechnical audiences could understand. Creating my code review video and building this ePortfolio pushed me to clearly explain how my applications work and why certain improvements were necessary. That process helped me develop confidence in communicating with peers, instructors, and future stakeholders. I learned that writing clean documentation and explaining decisions clearly is just as important as writing good code.
My understanding of data structures and algorithms improved significantly throughout the program. In courses like Data Structures and Algorithms, I learned how efficiency matters and how choosing the right structure can improve performance. Instead of just making something “work,” I started thinking about optimization, scalability, and trade-offs. This mindset has helped me approach problems in a more structured way. I now think about time complexity, data flow, and logic before jumping into implementation.
In software engineering and database courses, I learned how full systems connect together. I worked with MongoDB, SQL, Express, Angular, and Node to build full-stack applications. I also learned how to structure projects, separate concerns, and design applications in a way that makes them easier to maintain and improve. Working with Docker and AWS introduced me to cloud-based development and showed me how applications can scale beyond a single machine. These experiences helped shape my goal of becoming a full-stack or cloud-focused software engineer.
Security has also become an important part of how I think about development. Through secure coding concepts and authentication implementations, I learned that software must be built with a security mindset from the start. It is not just about adding features — it is about protecting user data, preventing vulnerabilities, and anticipating risks. This perspective will guide how I design and evaluate systems moving forward.
Beyond the technical skills, this program helped shape my professional values. I value writing clean, organized code. I value continuous improvement. And I value building systems that are efficient, secure, and user-friendly. Developing this ePortfolio gave me the opportunity to reflect on my growth and intentionally improve earlier work. It shows not only what I built, but how I improved it and why those improvements matter.
The artifacts included in this portfolio represent different areas of computer science working together. They demonstrate my skills in software design and engineering, algorithmic thinking, and database integration. Together, they show how I can analyze an existing system, improve its structure and performance, strengthen its security, and deliver a more professional final product.
This portfolio represents my development as a computer science graduate and my readiness to enter the field as a junior software engineer. It reflects my technical foundation, my ability to adapt and improve systems, and my commitment to building secure, scalable, and well-designed applications.
