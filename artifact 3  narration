The artifact used for this enhancement is the Travlr web application, a full-stack JavaScript project that uses MongoDB and Mongoose to store trip and user data. This project was originally created earlier in the computer science program and later selected for enhancement during the CS-499 capstone. The focus of this enhancement was improving how the application handles and stores data at the database level.
I chose this artifact because it already relied heavily on a database, which made it a good example for demonstrating database skills. In the original version, most validation and data checks happened in the controller logic, and the database schemas were fairly basic. This enhancement allowed me to move important responsibilities into the database itself, making the application more reliable and better structured. It also gave me a chance to show that I understand how to design databases that support real-world applications.
Several improvements were made to strengthen the database layer. The Trip schema was updated with stricter validation, better data types, and indexing to improve performance and prevent duplicate records. Fields such as pricing were stored as numbers instead of strings, and timestamps were added to track when records are created and updated. A compound index was also added to speed up common queries and improve data integrity.
The User schema was enhanced to better support authentication and security. Required fields were enforced, email addresses were validated and normalized, and a unique index was added to ensure each user is stored only once. In addition, the database connection logic was improved to support environment variables, allowing the same code to work in local development, Docker environments, or cloud deployments without modification.
This enhancement helped me better understand how important the database layer is to the overall quality of an application. One challenge was making sure the new validation rules and schema changes did not break existing functionality. Through this process, I learned how proper schema design, indexing, and configuration can improve performance, reduce errors, and make applications easier to maintain. This work strengthened my confidence in working with databases and showed my growth in designing more reliable and scalable software systems.
